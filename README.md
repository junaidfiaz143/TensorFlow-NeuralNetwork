In this project you will discover how to we create simple linear regression using TensorFlow.

## Getting Started

### Description of the Dataset
We just created simple sample dataset.

### What we achieved doing this Project:
In this post, you discovered the gradient descent optimizer and backpropagation.

You learned how you create ML models without any ML library, specifically:

+	How to use GradientDescent optimizer.
+	How to do BackPropagation.
+	How to visualize dataset, and output.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
puthon IDE
jupyter notebook
```
